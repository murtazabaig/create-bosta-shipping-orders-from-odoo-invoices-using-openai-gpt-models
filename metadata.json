  "description": "WHAT PROBLEM DOES IT SOLVE? * Manual Data Entry Bottlenecks: Moving shipping data from Odoo to Bosta manually is slow and prone to errors, especially during high-volume periods. * Address Mismatches: Odoo stores addresses as unstructured text, while Bosta requires strict Zone/District IDs. Mismatches lead to failed deliveries and returns. * Messy Labels: Long ERP product names look unprofessional on shipping labels. * This workflow solves these by: * Instantly creating the shipping order in Bosta when an Odoo invoice is confirmed. * Using an AI Agent to intelligently parse raw addresses and map them to the exact Bosta ID. * Ensuring the high operational standards required by automating data cleaning and COD rounding.HOW TO CONFIGURE IT1. ODOO SETUP * Create an Automation Rule in Odoo that sends a POST request to this workflow's Webhook URL when an invoice state changes to \"Confirmed\".2. CREDENTIALS * Connect your Odoo, OpenAI, and Telegram accounts in the respective n8n nodes. * Add your Bosta API Key in the Header parameters of the Create Bosta Order node.3. PRODUCT MAPPING * Open the Summarize Items code node and update the NAME_MAP object to link your Odoo product names to short shipping labels.4. DATA TABLE * Ensure the Fetch Zones node is connected to your Bosta Zones/Districts data table in n8n.HOW IT WORKS * Trigger: The workflow starts automatically when an invoice is confirmed in Odoo. * Fetch & Process: It pulls customer details and invoice items, then aggregates quantities (e.g., turning 3 lines of \"Shampoo\" into \"Shampoo (3)\"). * AI Analysis: The AI Agent cross-references the raw address with the official Bosta zones list to strictly select the correct IDs. * Execution: The order is created in Bosta. If successful, the process is complete. * Error Handling: If any step fails, a Telegram message is sent immediately with the invoice number to alert the operations team.CUSTOMIZATION IDEAS * Write Back: Add a node to update the Odoo invoice with the generated Bosta tracking number. * Multi-Courier: Add a switch node to route orders to different couriers (e.g., Aramex, Mylerz) based on the city. * Campaign Logging: Log successful shipments to a spreadsheet to track fulfillment metrics. * Notification Channels: Change the error alert from Telegram to Slack or Email.If you need any help Get in Touch [https://www.linkedin.com/in/abdallaelshikh0/]",
